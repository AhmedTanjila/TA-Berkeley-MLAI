### Project Name: “Will a customer accept the coupon?” 
## Data: This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).
## Summary of findings - 
# Drivers aged 25 to 30, who visit a bar more than once a month, have passengers who are not kids, and work in occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry, are more likely to accept the coupon.
# Drivers aged 25 or younger who visit a Coffee House more than once a month and are with friends are more likely to accept the coupon.
